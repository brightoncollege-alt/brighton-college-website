          <h2>A Place Where Learning Inspires Action</h2>
          <div className="prose" style={{ maxWidth: 860 }}>
            <p>
              The Brighton College, Razzar, was founded with a vision to bring true
              educational transformation — a place where learning is not confined to
              textbooks and exams, but where knowledge inspires action, character,
              and leadership. Our institution stands as a beacon of hope against the
              mechanical, memorization-driven systems prevalent today. Here, we
              cultivate critical thinkers, compassionate leaders, and creative minds
              who aim to brighten the world around them.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe that education must not only prepare students for jobs but
              also prepare them for life. At the Brighton, education is a light that
              enlightens communities, builds futures, and fulfills the deeper
              purposes of humanity.

                "The founding of Brighton College was our answer. We built an institution
                where hearts are free to educate in a way that touches hearts and opens
                minds — a system far removed from rote memorization and mechanical
                learning that produces individuals incapable of meaningful societal roles.
                Brighton College stands as a place where change can be felt by the
                community, where every student is nurtured as a torchbearer for a better tomorrow."
